    <h2>Statements about statements</h2>
    <p>Up until now done by “modeling” RDF statements in RDF</p>
    <p>Reification: cumbersome, misunderstood, unpopular</p>
    <ul>
        <li>one of the most persistent criticisms of RDF, particularly when comparing to Labeled Property Graphs (LPGs)</li>
        <li>could be seen as the RDF counterpart of Labeled Property Graph “edge properties” (RDF is more expressive, though)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Over the years, many ideas and proposals on how to fix this</p>
    <ul>
        <li>most notably, “Reification Done Right” by Hartig & Thompson in 2014</li>
        <li>RDR eventually parlayed into “RDF-Star”, first a CG, now a WG</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>Some use cases</h2>
    <p>Provenance</p>
    <p>Qualifying statements</p>
    <p>“Marginalia”</p>
    <p>Modalities (beliefs, etc.)</p>
    <p>Also: bringing RDF closer to LPGs (aka “alignment”)</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>Triples in an RDF graph are unique (remember: set semantics)</p>
    <p><pre>:ElizabethTaylor :married :RichardBurton</pre></p>
    <ul>
        <li>we want to qualify this with a year</li>
        <li>but... Taylor married Burton twice (1964 and 1975)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Breaking existing RDF (1.1) semantics is highly undesirable</p>
    <p>Introducing new semantics could have consequences for RDFS & OWL</p>
    <p>Relationship between statements and named graphs?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>is a reified statement a singleton named graph?</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>Semantics proposal</h2>
    <p>We have extended the RDF 1.1 semantics with “triple terms”</p>
    <ul>
        <li>triples are formed using IRIs, blank nodes, literals, and triple terms</li>
        <li>an occurrence of a triple is identified by a reifying resource (aka a “reifier”) related to a triple term</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have agreed on a minimal baseline as a means of comparing proposals</p>
    <ul>
        <li>we introduce minimal semantics and semantics for the well-formed fragment of RDF (we call this “RDF semantics”)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have two alternate, extended baselines we are still discussing</p>
    <ul>
        <li>these essentially differ in how a reifier is related to triple terms</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>Syntax proposal</h2>
    <p>We extend Turtle with some “syntactic sugar”:</p>
    <p>Occurrence syntax (or "unasserted syntax", still debating this):  <pre><< :s :p :o ~ :id >> :pp :oo</pre></p>
    <p>Annotation syntax:  <pre>:s :p :o {| :pp :oo |}</pre></p>
    <p>“Triple term” syntax (only for internal use):  <pre><<(:s :p :o)>></pre></p>
    <p>(Niklas Lindström will get into the details in the next presentation.)</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>Current status</h2>
    <p>It took us a long time to agree on the “big picture” (but we now have more or less reached consensus within the WG)</p>
    <p>RDF 1.1 semantics has been extended (this was the really important part)</p>
    <p>We have lots of documents that now need to all be updated (essentially all RDF and SPARQL specs)</p>
    <p>“RDF-Star” name will go away and we get “RDF 1.2” and “SPARQL 1.2”</p>
